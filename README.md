### ***Description***
A localozized social app for families to share things most important to them: pictures, recipes, memories, & plans. Will have a family tree lineage space to see pictures of ancestors, & be easy to navigate & simple with the intent of it being used regularly by older folk who didn't grow up with technology. Will have a calendar for family events.
